abstract = {One of the most important methods for evaluating the characteristics of ad hoc networking protocols is through the use of simulation. Simulation provides researchers with a number of significant benefits, including repeatable scenarios, isolation of parameters, and exploration of a variety of metrics. The topology and movement of the nodes in the simulation are key factors in the performance of the network protocol under study. Once the nodes have been initially distributed, the mobility model dictates the movement of the nodes within the network. Because the mobility of the nodes directly impacts the performance of the protocols, simulation results obtained with unrealistic movement models may not correctly reflect the true performance of the protocols. The majority of existing mobility models for ad hoc networks do not provide realistic movement scenarios; they are limited to random walk models without any obstacles. In this paper, we propose to create more realistic movement models through the incorporation of obstacles. These obstacles are utilized to both restrict node movement as well as wireless transmissions. In addition to the inclusion of obstacles, we construct movement paths using the Voronoi diagram of obstacle vertices. Nodes can then be randomly distributed across the paths, and can use shortest path route computations to destinations at randomly chosen obstacles. Simulation results show that the use of obstacles and pathways has a significant impact on the performance of ad hoc network protocols.},

abstract = {A Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is a collection of wireless mobile nodes forming a self-configuring network without using any existing infrastructure. Since MANETs are not currently deployed on a large scale, research in this area is mostly simulation based. Among other simulation parameters, the mobility model plays a very important role in determining the protocol performance in MANET. Thus, it is essential to study and analyze various mobility models and their effect on MANET protocols. In this chapter, we survey and examine different mobility models proposed in the recent research literature. Beside the commonly used Random Waypoint model and its variants, we also discuss various models that exhibit the characteristics of temporal dependency, spatial dependency and geographic constraint. Hence, we attempt to provide an overview of the current research status of mobility modeling and analysis.},

@article{Mohimani2009,
abstract = {The mobility pattern of users is one of the distinct features of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) compared with other types of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). This is due to the higher speed and the roadmap-restricted movement of vehicles. In this paper, we propose a new analytical mobility model for VANETs based on product-form queueing networks. In this model, we map the topology of the streets and the behavior of vehicles at both intersections and different parts of the streets onto different parameters of a BCMP open queueing network comprising M/G/infin nodes. This model represents a sparse situation for VANETs. To include the effect of dense situation on the mobility model, we modify the proposed queueing network as a new one comprising nodes with state-dependent service rates, i.e., M/G(n)/infin nodes. With respect to the product-form solution property of the proposed queueing networks, we are able to find the spatial traffic distribution for vehicles at both sparse and dense situations. Furthermore, we are able to modify the proposed queueing network to find the lower and upper bounds for the probability of connectivity. In the last part of this paper, we show the flexibility of the proposed model by several numerical examples and confirm our modeling approach by simulation.},

abstract = {Mobility models are used to simulate and evaluate the performance of mobile wireless systems and the algorithms and protocols at the basis of them. The definition of realistic mobility models is one of the most critical and, at the same time, difficult aspects of the simulation of applications and systems designed for mobile environments. There are essentially two possible types of mobility patterns that can be used to evaluate mobile network protocols and algorithms by means of simulations: traces and synthetic models. Traces are obtained by means of measurements of deployed systems and usually consist of logs of connectivity or location information, whereas synthetic models are mathematical models, such as sets of equations, which try to capture the movement of the devices.},
