	Signal will fade during the transmitting and power will somewhat loss no matter what kind of transmitter you use. As a result, we can estimate the distance between the receiver and transmitter if we know the properties the the wireless signal. Meanwhile, the phase of signal will shift when receiver get a signal, which related to their direction of arrival. In this case, out project decide to use the MUSIC algorithm and path loss to estimate direction and distance between multiple robots.
