\subsection{Formula}
To simplify our simulation, we decide to use a simple version of path loss, which is:
\begin{equation}
L(d)=10*n*log_{10}d + C
\end{equation}
where L is the path loss in decibels, n is the path loss exponent, d is the distance between the transmitter and the receiver, usually measured in meters, and C is a constant which accounts for system losses.

Rayleigh distributed probability density function is:
\begin{equation}
p_{R}(r)={\frac {2r}{\Omega }}e^{-r^{2}/\Omega },\ r\geq {}0
\end{equation}
where R is random variable, $\Omega$ = E($R^{2}$).

The probability density function p of a normal distribution random variable z in our case is:
\begin{equation}
p_{G}(z)={\frac {1}{ {\sqrt {2\pi }}}}e^{-{\frac {z^{2}}{2}}}
\end{equation}
where z represents the grey level, $\mu$  the mean value and $\sigma$  the standard deviation
