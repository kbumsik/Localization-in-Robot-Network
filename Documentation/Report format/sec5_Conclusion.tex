\section{Conclusion}
\indent 
	According to our simulation result, we can see that due to the small distance between four antennas in one robots, we can only see the three range circle for each robot instead of 12, which make sense since this indicates that the distance of four antennas will not effect our distance measurement much. In terms of power vs. distance result, we can see that when distance is greater than about 380-600 meters, the signal strength will be less than -75db, which is the medium quality of signal. As a result, we can conclude that in our case, the largest range that may be acceptable is approximately 450 meters, and we will get high quality signal when it is greater than -55db, which is within about 50 meters. 
\par
	We will also have a better understanding why the noise is a big challenge in our project, since signal receiving with noise gives us a signal strength with big tolerance, for example, it's about 220 meters tolerance when calculate medium quality range, which will cause a big difference when evaluating the location.
\par
	The future plan is to be more proficient using MUSIC algorithm and enhance our methodology of distance calculating. As we can see, the current simulation indicates we will have a big tolerance of distance.
