\subsection{Background}
There are many robots created to improve quality of our life, so the AI of robots can make a great contribution. What's more, we may want to easily find a specific room location even when we are not familiar with the place. We can navigate our outdoor position with GPS, but it is hard for us to know our indoor position with our smart devices. All of these problems lead to the topic on how to implement the localization of our robots.
