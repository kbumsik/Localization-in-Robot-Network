\section{Conclusion}
\indent 
	According to our simulation result, we can see that due to the small distance between four antennas in one robots, we can only see the three range circle for each robot instead of 12, which make sense since this indicates that the distance of four antennas will not effect our distance measurement much. 
	\par
	In terms of power vs. distance result, we can see that when distance is greater than about 380-600 meters, the signal strength will be less than -75db, which is the medium quality of signal. As a result, we can conclude that in our case, the largest range that can be acceptable is approximately 450 meters, and we will get high quality signal when it is greater than -55db, which means robot can get good quality about ninety percent within 50 meters of a transmitter.
	\par
	We will also have a better understanding why the noise is a big challenge in our project, since received signal with noise gives us a signal strength with big tolerance, for example, it's about 220 meters tolerance when calculating medium quality range, which will cause a big difference when evaluating the location.
\par
	The future plan is to be more proficient using MUSIC algorithm and enhance our methodology of distance calculating. As we can see, the current simulation indicates we will have a big tolerance of distance.\cite{speedguide}
