	We conduct a simulation using the procedure described above. We put four robots in the simulation field and draw three range, representing the sensory range, communication range, and rejection range, for each robots. We draw straight lines between robots with the average signal strength of four antenna of robots between them instead of the signal strength of each robots for a better visualization. In this simulation we assumed following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The frequency of the transceiver is at 2.4 Gigahertz range.
	\item Each robots is using different frequency channel so that each signal cannot interfere another.
	\item The reference distance of the transceiver is 1.8 meters and the receiving power at the reference distance is -27.25 decibel. The standard deviation of the Gaussian white noise is 1, since we do not know the real antenna's Signal-to-Noise Ratio.
	\item The sensory range, the communication range, and the rejection range are 200 meters, 100 meters, and 100 meters respectively.
\end{itemize}

	The example results of the simulation are the following figures: figure 9 and figure 10. Figure 10 shows the signal strength against distance to visualize the relationship between signal strength and distance. Asides from the effect of the White Gaussian Noise and the Fading, it shows that it has a logarithmic relationship. Figure 9 shows four simulation results that the four robots are randomly placed and the average signal strength are measured accordingly. The simulation result in figure 9 shows that the measured average signal strength are measured differently with distance. It also shows that the robots around the communication range has signal strength around -60db, and the robots within the sensory range have signal strength of more than -70db, whereas the signal strength between two robots outside of the sensory range is measured less than -70db. \\

	To have better understanding of DOA pmuisc function, we implement angle\_ gui.m file to show the simple version of the MUSIC algorithm. Since every robot has four antennas, the receiving signal will be a $1 * 4$ matrix of four signal strength from these antennas. We obtain DOA by applying pmuisc function to the signal matrix.\\

When robots are gathering together within their communication range, we can evaluate the coverage area of the robot network 
system. The ideal maximum range is when each robot's center is located on the edge of other robot's communication range with the first three leading robots forms triangle group like the following graph.
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{ideal}
	\caption{Ideal coverage}
	%\label{fig1}
	\end{figure}
	
The area of ideal case is 1.6058e+05 square meters over 1000*1000 square meters moving area. However, the simulation coverage area is always smaller than ideal area.
The following graph is one of the example of simulation. Eight robots are gathering together and the right graph is their 
topology graph. 
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{sample}
	\caption{Simulation sample}
	%\label{fig1}
	\end{figure}
We calculate the area of simulation area by the number of random points located in coverage area over total number of points
in moving area times the moving area. To get accurate coverage area, we apply 1000 million random points. The result is 1.5883e+05 square meters. So the coverage difference between ideal and simulation is 1.09 \%.
